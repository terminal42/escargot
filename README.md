# Escargot

[![](https://travis-ci.com/terminal42/escargot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/terminal42/escargot)

A library that provides everything you need to crawl anything based on HTTP and process the responses in whatever
way you prefer based on Symfony components.

### Why yet another crawler?

There are so many different implementations in so many programming languages, right?
Well, the ones I found in PHP did not really live up to my personal quality standards and also I wanted something
that's built on top of the [Symfony HttpClient][Symfony_HTTPClient] component and is not bound to crawl websites (HTML) only but can
be used as the foundation for anything you may want to crawl. Hence, yet another library.

### What about that name «Escargot»?

When I created this library I didn't want to name it «crawler» or «spider» or anything similar that's been used
hundreds of times before. So I started to think about things that actually crawl and one thing that came to my mind
immediately were snails. But «snail» doesn't really sound super beautiful and so I just went with the French translation
for it which is «escargot». There you go! Also French is a beautiful language anyway and in case you didn't know: tons of
libraries in the PHP ecosystem were invented and are still maintained by French people so it's also some kind of tribute
to the French PHP community (and Symfony one for that matter).

By the way: Thanks to the Symfony HttpClient `Escargot` is actually not slow at all ;-)

### Installation

```bash
composer require terminal42/escargot
```

### Usage

Everything in `Escargot` is assigned to a job ID. The reason for this design is that crawling huge amounts of URIs
can take very long and chances that you'll want to stop at some point and pick up where you left are pretty high.
For that matter, every `Escargot` instance also needs a queue plus a base URI collection as to where to start crawling.
Of course, because we execute requests, we can also provide an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClientInterface`
but that's completely optional. If you do not provide any client, `HttpClient::create()` will be used and the best
client is automatically chosen for you.

#### Instantiating Escargot

The factory method when you do not have a job ID yet has to be used as follows:

```php
<?php

use Nyholm\Psr7\Uri;
use Terminal42\Escargot\BaseUriCollection;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Escargot;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Queue\InMemoryQueue;

$baseUris = new BaseUriCollection();
$baseUris->add(new Uri('https://www.terminal42.ch'));
$queue = new InMemoryQueue();
        
$escargot = Escargot::create($baseUris, $queue);
```

If you want to use a special `HttpClientInterface` implementation, you can provide this as the third argument:

```php
<?php

use Nyholm\Psr7\Uri;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\CurlHttpClient;
use Terminal42\Escargot\BaseUriCollection;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Escargot;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Queue\InMemoryQueue;

$baseUris = new BaseUriCollection();
$baseUris->add(new Uri('https://www.terminal42.ch'));
$queue = new InMemoryQueue();
$client = new CurlHttpClient(['custom' => 'options']);
        
$escargot = Escargot::create($baseUris, $queue, $client);
```

In case you already do have a job ID because you have initiated crawling previously we do not need any base URI collection
anymore but the job ID instead (again `$client` is completely optional):

```php
<?php

use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\CurlHttpClient;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Escargot;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Queue\InMemoryQueue;

$queue = new InMemoryQueue();
$client = new CurlHttpClient(['custom' => 'options']); // optional
        
$escargot = Escargot::createFromJobId($jobId, $queue, $client);
```
   
#### The different queue implementations

As explained before, the queue is an essential part of `Escargot` because it keeps track of all the URIs that have been
requested already but it is also responsible to pick up where one left based on a given job ID.
You can create your own queue and store the information wherever you like by implementing the `QueueInterface`.
This library ships with the following implementations for you to use:

* `InMemoryQueue` - an in-memory queue. Mostly useful for testing or CLI usages. Once the process ends, data will be lost.

* `DoctrineQueue` - a Doctrine DBAL queue. Stores the data in your Doctrine/PDO compatible database so it's persistent.

* `LazyQueue` - a queue that takes two `QueueInterface` implementations as arguments. It will try to work on the primary
  queue as long as possible and fall back to the second queue only if needed. The result can be transferred from the
  first queue to the second queue by using the `commit()` method. The use case is mainly to prevent e.g. the database
  from being hammered by using `$queue = new LazyQueue(new InMemoryQueue(), new DoctrineQueue())`. That way you get
  persistence (by calling `$queue->commit($jobId)` once done) combined with efficiency. 

#### Start crawling

After we have our `Escargot` instance, we can start crawling which we do by calling the `crawl()` method:

```php
<?php

$escargot->crawl();
```

#### Subscribers

You might be wondering how you can access the results of your crawl process. In `Escargot`, `crawl()` does not return
anything but instead, everything is passed on to subscribers which lets you decide exactly on what you want to do with the
results that are collected along the way.
The flow of every request executed by `Escargot` is as follows which maps to the corresponding methods in the subscribers:

1. Decide whether a request should be sent at all (if no subscriber requests the request, none is executed):
   
   `SubscriberInterface:shouldRequest()`
   
2. If a request was sent, wait for the first response chunk and decide whether the whole response body should be loaded
   
   `SubscriberInterface:needsContent()`
   
3. If the body was requested, the data is passed on to the subscribers on the last response chunk that arrives:
   
   `SubscriberInterface:onLastChunk()`

Adding a subscriber is accomplished by implementing the `SubscriberInterface` and registering it
using `Escargot::addSubscriber()`:

```php
<?php

$escargot->addSubscriber(new MySubscriber());
```

According to the flow of every request, the `SubscriberInterface` asks you to implement `3` methods:

*   `shouldRequest(CrawlUri $crawlUri, string $currentDecision): string;`

    This method is called before a request is executed. Note that the logic is inverted: If none of the registered
    subscribers asks Escargot to execute the request, it's not going to be requested. That allows for a lot more
    flexibility. If it was the other way around, one subscriber could cancel the request and thus cause another
    subscriber to not get any results. You may return one of the following `3` constants:
    
    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_POSITIVE`
    
    If you return a positive decision. Escargot will request the provided `CrawlUri` instance.
    
    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_NEGATIVE`
    
    If you return a negative decision. Escargot will not request the provided `CrawlUri` instance.

    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_ABSTAIN`
    
    If you return an abstain decision, Escargot will not request the provided `CrawlUri` instance.
    This likely never the return value you're looking for but the initial state before any subscriber is called.
    If you don't want to interfere with what previous subscribers decided, return the provided `$currentDecision`.

*   `needsContent(CrawlUri $crawlUri, ResponseInterface $response, ChunkInterface $chunk, string $currentDecision): string;`

    This method is called on the first chunk of a request that arrives. You have access to all the headers now but the content
    of the response might not yet be loaded. Note that the logic is inverted: If none of the
    registered subscribers asks Escargot to provide the content, it's going to cancel the request and thus early abort.
    Again you may return one of the following `3` constants:
    
    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_POSITIVE`
    
    If you return a positive decision. Escargot will continue to request and serve the content on `onLastChunk()`.
    
    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_NEGATIVE`
    
    If you return a negative decision. Escargot will abort the request and not serve the content on `onLastChunk()`.

    * `SubscriberInterface::DECISION_ABSTAIN`
    
    If you return an abstain decision, Escargot will abort the request and not serve the content on `onLastChunk()`.
    This likely never the return value you're looking for but the initial state before any subscriber is called.
    If you don't want to interfere with what previous subscribers decided, return the provided `$currentDecision`.

*   `onLastChunk(CrawlUri $crawlUri, ResponseInterface $response, ChunkInterface $chunk): void;`

    If one of the subscribers returned a positive decision during the `needsContent()` phase, **all** of the subscribers
    will receive the content of the response. The reason for this design is that you may have a listener that doesn't
    require to have the whole content loaded but still wants to analyze it in case any other subscriber requested the
    full response content.
    

There are `2` other interfaces which you might want to integrate but you don't have to:

*   `ExceptionSubscriberInterface::onException(ExceptionInterface $exception, ResponseInterface $response): void;`

    In case there's an exception during the request execution (see the [Symfony HttpClient docs for more information][Symfony_HTTPClient])
    it's caught and passed on to subscribers implementing this interface.

*   `FinishedCrawlingSubscriberInterface::finishedCrawling(): void;`

    Once crawling is finished (that does not mean there's no pending queue items, you may also have reached the maximum
    number of requests), all subscribers implementing this interface will be called.


#### Tags

Sometimes you may want to add meta information to any `CrawlUri`  instance so you can let other subscribers decide
what they want to do with this information or it may be relevant during another request.
The `RobotsSubscriber` for instance, tags `CrawlUri` instances when they contained a `<meta name="robots" content="nofollow">`
in the body or the corresponding `X-Robots-Tag` header was set. All the links found on this URI are then not followed
which happens during the next `shouldRequest()` call.

#### Crawling websites (HTML crawler)

When people read the word «crawl» or «crawler» they usually immediately think of crawling websites. Granted, this is
also the main purpose of this library but if you think about it, nothing you have learnt about `Escargot` so far was
related to crawling websites or HTML. `Escargot` can crawl anything that's based on HTTP and you could write a subscriber
that extracts e.g. new URIs from JSON responses and continue from there.

Awesome isn't it?

To turn our `Escargot` instance into a proper web crawler, we can register the `2` following subscribers shipped
by default:
  
* The `RobotsSubscriber`

  This subscriber handles `robots.txt` content, the `X-Robots-Tag` header and the `<meta name="robots">` HTML tag.
  So it
  
  * Sets `CrawlUri` tags according to the `X-Robots-Tag` header.
  * Sets `CrawlUri` tags according to the `<meta name="robots">` HTML tag.
  * Analyzes `Sitemap` entries in the `robots.txt` and adds the URIs found there to the queue.
  * Handles disallowed paths based on the `robots.txt` content.
  
  By default, this subscriber will never cause any requests to be executed because it doesn't care if anything is
  requested. But if it is, it wants to add meta information (tags) on all the found `CrawlUri` instances.

* The `HtmlCrawlerSubscriber`

  This subscriber analyzes the HTML and then searches for links and adds those to the queue.
  It
    
  * Sets `CrawlUri` tags if the link contained the `rel="nofollow` attribute.
  * Sets `CrawlUri` tags if the link contained the attribute `type` and the value was not equal to `text/html`.
  * Sets `CrawlUri` tags if the link points to any host which is not part of the `BaseUriCollection`.
 
  By default, this subscriber will ask for requests to be executed unless any previous subscriber has already returned
  a negative decision on `shouldRequest()` in which case it will not overrule this decision.
 
Using them is done like so:

```php
<?php

use Terminal42\Escargot\Subscriber\HtmlCrawlerSubscriber;
use Terminal42\Escargot\Subscriber\RobotsSubscriber;

$escargot->addSubscriber(new RobotsSubscriber());
$escargot->addSubscriber(new HtmlCrawlerSubscriber());
```

You now have a full-fledged web crawler. It's up to you now to register additional subscribers to actually do something
with the results.

### Configuration

There are different configurations you can apply to the `Escargot` instance:

* `Escargot::withMaxRequests(int $maxRequests): Escargot`

   Returns a clone of the `Escargot` instance with a maximum total requests that are going to be executed. It can be
   useful if you have limited resources and only want to execute e.g. `100` requests in this run and continue later on.
   
* `Escargot::withUserAgent(string $userAgent): Escargot`

   Returns a clone of the `Escargot` instance with a different `User-Agent` header. The header is sent with all the
   requests and by default configured to `terminal42/escargot`.

* `Escargot::withConcurrency(int $concurrency): Escargot`

   Returns a clone of the `Escargot` instance with a maximum concurrent requests that are going to be sent at a time.
   By default, this is configured to `10`.
   
* `Escargot::withRequestDelay(int $requestDelay): Escargot`

   Returns a clone of the `Escargot` instance with an added delay between requests in microseconds. By default, there's
   no extra  delay. It can be useful to make sure `Escargot` does not run into some (D)DOS protection or similar issues.

* `Escargot::withLogger(LoggerInterface $logger): Escargot`

   Returns a clone of the `Escargot` instance with your PSR-3 `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` instance to gain more insight
   in what's happening in `Escargot`.
   
### Roadmap / Ideas

* This is just an alpha version so please expect things to break. I'm going to follow SemVer for this library
  which is why we have 0.x version numbers for now unit I personally find it to be stable enough to release 
  version 1.0.0.
  
* What about having `Escargot` interpret JavaScript before starting to crawl the content? Should be possible
  by having an `HttpClientInterface` implementation that bridges to `symfony/panther` or `facebook/webdriver`
  directly. PR's welcome!

* Maybe one day, some talented illustrator finds this library and enhances it with a nice logo? :-)
  
* I'm a core dev member of [Contao, an open source CMS](https://contao.org). I would like to integrate `Escargot` there
  in one of the upcoming versions to improve the way search indexing is achieved. I guess you should know that I will
  likely not be tagging it stable before I've finished the integration but we'll see.
